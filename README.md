# Airport simulation project

My approach to application developed for university exam.

Application relies on API developed by teaching assistant [Pequla](https://github.com/Pequla)

Project contains several vulnerabilities (1 moderate, 5 high, 3 critical), however it will be used for demonstrational purposes only and in controlled environment.
