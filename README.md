# Airport simulation project

My approach to application developed for university exam.

Application relies on API developed by teaching assistant [Pequla](https://github.com/Pequla)

Project contains several vulnerabilities, however it will be used for demonstrational purposes only and in controlled environment, thus vulnerabilities can be ignored.
