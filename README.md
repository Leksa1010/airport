# Airport simulation project

My approach to application developed for university exam.

Application relies on API developed by teaching assistant [Pequla](https://github.com/Pequla)

Project contains several vulnerabilities, however it will be used for demonstrational purposes only and in controlled environment, thus vulnerabilities can be ignored.

This project displays all flights and destination form Belgrade Airport Nikola Tesla (BEG). Home page display all flights - arrivals and departures.

Unauthenticated users can view all flights and destinations but are unable to book a ticket. Authenticated usesrs can book a ticket and view their tickets.
